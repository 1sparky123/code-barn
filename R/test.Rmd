#### what is a light bulb but an enslaved sun?

How quirky and gnarly, here is the table set of the light bulb ID number: $5372$

## Table
```{r bulb, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(data4led)
bulb <- led_bulb(1,seed = 5372)
head(bulb)
```
How quirky and gnarly, it looks like this is a plot of the light bulb to better see correlations between time and intensity:

## Plot
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

x <- bulb$hours
y <- bulb$percent_intensity
plot(x,y, pch = 16,
  ylab = "% Intensity",
  xlab = "hours")
#plot(percent_intensity ~ hours, data = bulb, pch = 5, col = "#ff11d3")
```
In general there seems to be a square root function that slowly degrades as time goes on
